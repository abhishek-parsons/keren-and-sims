          What did you like the most about the sims interface?
        </div>
        <div class="div3-answer">
          In Sims, everything is interactive. From people to objects. So a fun
          part of the interface was clicking on the sims and objects to see all
          the ways I could interact with them. It was fun learning about the
          different things I could say to different people and the ways I could
          play around with the objects in the game.
