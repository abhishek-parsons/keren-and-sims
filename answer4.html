        <div class="div3-answer">
          Since I used to play with dolls as a kid, conceptually I was familiar
          with role playing games like The Sims. However, the learning curve was
          around learning how to use all the features in the game. When I first
          played it, my friend took control and showed me how to play the game,
          but after, I picked it up for myself and started playing.
